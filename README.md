# Tomato-Leaf-Disease-Prediction-using-VGG16-and-CNN
Aims to predict diseases in tomato plants based on images of their leaves using the VGG16 and CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) architectures.
# Project Overview
Tomato plants are susceptible to various diseases, which can negatively impact crop yield and quality. Early detection and accurate diagnosis of these diseases are crucial for implementing timely preventive measures. This project focuses on developing a machine learning model using the VGG16 and CNN architectures to predict the presence of diseases in tomato plants based on images of their leaves.
